# Venice 1740 Transportation â€“ Multimodal Traffic Assignment

This repository contains code and data for the analysis of multimodal (walking + traghetto/ferry) transportation in 18th-century Venice, using historical parish and property data from the 1740s. The main analysis implements traffic assignment models to understand cross-canal connectivity, demand, and economic implications of the traghetti network.
